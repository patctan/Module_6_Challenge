# Module_6_Challenge

This web application is designed to display the current weather, as well as the weather for the next five days, for the city that the user inputs.

## Future Improvements

With the current version of the application, several issues need to be fixed, which will be addressed below:

1. The Event Listeners for the buttons generated in the Recent Searches section are not functioning properly and need to display weather information for the appropriate city when clicked.

2. The cards displaying the Five Day Forecast do not display when the first city is input, but will display cards from the second city onwards.

3. The cards that are generated do not remove themselves when a new city is input, and instead new cards will be added to the list of pre-existing cards.

4. The dates for the Five Day Forecast, as well as the current date are not displayed when the weather info is displayed.

5. Info for the UV index for the current day is not displayed.
